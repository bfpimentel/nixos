# bfpimentel's nixOS configs

⚠️ This is an work in progress project so doesn't expect any stability of it. It's just for demo purposes and something to learn.

This repo contains configurations for my NixOS machines:
1. *blackbox*: Homelab powered by NixOS entirely for ease of setup. 
2. *solaire*: MacOS (Darwin) machine powered by NixOS package manager for environment and user configuration.
